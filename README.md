# License Plate Recognition System using Digital Image Processing

## Here we used flask for the server 
## And DIP techniques to recognize text in the license plate


## Here we are using 2 servers for both the clients running on different ports
## To start the flask server **-->** Navigate to one of the client directory **flask run --port=8080** or **python app.py**
